    <h2>Gajar ka Halwa</h2>
    <p>Gajar ka Halwa is an Indian Carrot Pudding that is made with carrots, milk, sugar, ghee, cardamom, and nuts. It's delicious with a cup of chai. This recipe is widely popular in Northern India and is made during the winter months, parties, and festivals.
      Ingredients
      Carrots: Gajar in English is known as carrots. For this recipe, you need to grate the carrots or use a food processor. If you can get your hands on red carrots during the fall/winter season, make sure to use red carrots. In the United States, red carrots are hard to find, however in India, they are more easily available.
      Ghee: This recipe uses a total of 2 tablespoons of ghee, divided. Please don't use butter for this recipe, the taste is simply not the same.
      Milk: I recommend using whole milk for this recipe, however if you want to cut down on some fat, you may also use reduced-fat 2% milk. 
      Sugar: I don't like overly sweet desserts, so I used just the right amount of sugar in this recipe. Also remember, carrots are naturally sweet.
      Cardamom Powder: A touch of cardamom powder goes a long way. You can make some in a coffee grinder, or you can easily find some at Whole Foods. 
      Cashews: Chop some cashews and this will be added towards the end of the recipe.
      How To Make Gajar Halwa 
      1. Peel the carrots. Grate the carrots - I used the smaller side of the shred der. You can do it by hand or use a food processor.
      2. Heat a wok on medium heat, once hot, add 1 tablespoon of ghee. 
      3. Add the grated carrots and saute for about 8 minutes until the color of the carrots changes.
      4. Keep stirring to avoid burning. This is a labor of love.
      5. Add milk to the grated carrots. Cook the carrots and milk down for 6-7 minutes until all the milk is absorbed by the carrots.
      6. Keep stirring to avoid sticking and burning.
      7. Once all the milk is absorbed, this is what you should have.
      
      8. Add the sugar.
      9. Immediately after, add 1 more tablespoon of ghee.
      10. Keep stirring. until all the water is absorbed which is left behind by the sugar. This process will take about 5-6 minutes.
      
      11. Once done, add cardamom powder. Stir.
      12. Add chopped cashews. You can also add almonds, pistachios, and raisins, however I just stick with cashews.
      13. Mix well.
      14. Dry roast the Carrot Pudding for a couple more minutes so the color of the carrots deepens slightly. Turn off the stove.</p>

    <h2>Panipuri</h2>
    <p>Pani puri is a deep-fried breaded sphere filled with potato, onion, or chickpea. It is a common street food in the Indian subcontinent. It is often spiced with tamarind chutney, chili powder, or chaat masala.[3][4][5] A Bengali variant, fuchka,[b] uses spiced mashed potatoes and dal or ghugni as the filling.

      Ingredients
      2 to 3 potatoes – medium-sized, 1 onion – small to medium-sized, optional, 1 to 1.5 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves (cilantro),teaspoon roasted cumin powder,teaspoon chaat masala powder,¼ teaspoon red chili powder – optional,black salt or regular salt or pink salt, as required
      How to make Pani Puri
      Rinse 1 cup tightly packed coriander leaves, ½ cup tightly packed mint leaves, 2 to 3 green chilies and 1 inch ginger very well in water a few times. Drain all the water.Peel the ginger and roughly chop it. Also chop the green chilies. Roughly chop the coriander leaves and mint leaves. Don’t use the stem of mint leaves as they can make the spiced water have a bitter taste. Only use the fresh mint leaves.
      Add coriander leaves, mint leaves, ginger and green chili in a grinder or blender jar. For a less spicy pani you can add just 1 chopped green chilli.
      Add 1 tablespoon tightly packed tamarind and 3.5 to 4 tablespoons jaggery powder or grated jaggery.If you do not have tamarind, then you can use 2 tablespoons lemon juice. You can also use equal amounts of jaggery and dates. So you can add 2 tablespoons crumbled jaggery and 2 tablespoons chopped dates.
      Now add 1 teaspoon roasted cumin powder, 1 teaspoon chaat masala and salt as per taste. You can also use a mix of black salt and pink salt or regular salt. I personally prefer to use either black salt or edible rock salt.
       Add ⅓ cup water and grind to a smooth consistency.
      Remove the chutney to a bowl or a small pan.
      Add this water to the bowl containing the chutney.
      Now add ½ cup water in the grinder jar and swirl the jar so that the chutney at the sides of the jar gets mixed with the water.
      Then add ½ to ¾ cup water. You can add less or more water depending on the consistency you want. But do not add too much water as then the taste and flavor of the spiced water reduces. Also check the taste and if required you can add some more jaggery or salt as required.
      
      10.Mix very well. Cover the pan and refrigerate the pani. Before refrigerating you can also add 1 to 1.5 tablespoons of salted boondi.Boondi also gives a good taste. It can also be made at home or purchased easily from grocery stores.
      11.Boil 2 to 3 medium-sized potatoes. You can boil or steam the potatoes in a pan, instant pot or stovetop pressure cooker adding water as required.
      When warm, peel them and chop them into small cubes. You can also add some steamed or boiled moong sprouts. Some finely chopped onions can also be added. I have added 1 small-sized finely chopped onion.
      12. Add 1 to 1.5 tablespoon chopped coriander leaves.
      13. Then add ¼ teaspoon red chili powder, 1 teaspoon chaat masala and 1 teaspoon roasted cumin powder. Also add salt as per taste.
      14. Stir and mix very well. Keep aside.
      15. Keep everything ready before you start assembling the pani puri. The potato filling, pooris and the spiced water.In the photos below, I have made sweet tamarind dates chutney, just to show the assembling.First crack the top of the puri with a spoon or with your fingers or thumb. Then stuff the potato filling in the puri with a spoon.Add a few teaspoons of sweet chutney or as per your choice. The addition of sweet chutney is optional for the pani recipe shared in this post.
      6. Then add a few teaspoons of the green spiced water or as per your choice.
      
      17. The pani puri is ready to serve. Pop in your mouth, eat every bite and enjoy the burst of various flavors and textures. Make sure to eat them immediately as you prepare each puri.
      They have to be had immediately. Or else the puris become soggy. To make a Mumbai style pani puri recipe, use ragda or moong sprouts as the filling.
      The puri or pooris for making pani puri are made from flour or sooji (cream of wheat or rava) or both. These can be brought ready from the stores or can be made at home too.
      If you want to make pooris at home, then check this post -> Puri recipe for golgappa.
      For the stuffing, you can use your choice of fillings. At home we prefer moong sprouts or ragda. You can also use boiled potatoes and onions. Even boiled white chickpeas or black chickpeas can be used along with boiled potatoes.
      Assemble everything before you begin to make pani puri.
      You can prepare the spiced water before a few hours and then chill it in the fridge. You can also make it overnight and keep it in the fridge.
      Adding ice cubes may dilute the taste and flavor of the water.
      Addition of black salt gives a really good taste and flavor. So if possible do try to add black salt in the pani recipe.
      16. Then add a few teaspoons of the green spiced water or as per your choice.
      17. The pani puri is ready to serve. Pop in your mouth, eat every bite and enjoy the burst of various flavors and textures. Make sure to eat them immediately as you prepare each puri.They have to be had immediately. Or else the puris become soggy. To make a Mumbai style pani puri recipe, use ragda or moong sprouts as the filling.

    <h2>Samosa</h2>
    <p>A samosa (/səˈmoʊsə/) (listenⓘ) is a fried South Asian[2] pastry with a savoury filling, including ingredients such as spiced potatoes, onions, peas, meat, or fish. It may take different forms, including triangular, cone, or half-moon shapes, depending on the region.[3][4][5] Samosas are often accompanied by chutney, and have origins in medieval times or earlier.[3] Sweet versions are also made. Samosas are a popular entrée, appetizer, or snack in the cuisines of South Asia, the Middle East, Central Asia, East Africa and their South Asian diasporas.

      Ingredients
      2 cup all purpose flour
      1 teaspoon cumin seeds
      1 teaspoon crushed ginger
      1 teaspoon raisins
      5 boiled potato
      1 teaspoon coriander powder
      1 teaspoon red chilli powder
      1 teaspoon kasoori methi leaves
      1 teaspoon carom seeds
      1/4 cup water
      2 cup virgin olive oil
      1/2 teaspoon coriander seeds
      1 teaspoon green chilli
      1 teaspoon cashews
      1 teaspoon cumin powder
      1/2 teaspoon garam masala powder
      salt as required
      1 teaspoon coriander leaves
      2 tablespoon ghee
      1 handful raw peanuts
      How to make Samosa
      Step 1 Sauté cumin seeds for potato filling
      To make delicious samosas at home, first, make the filling. Put a pan on medium flame and add 2 tsp olive oil in it. Once the oil is hot enough, add cumin seeds and allow them to crackle.
      Step 2 Add spices and boiled potatoes and cook for a while
      Now, add whole coriander seeds, ginger and green chilli. Saute for a minute and then add chopped cashews and raisins, peanuts if you like them, boiled and mashed potatoes, cumin powder, coriander powder, garam masala powder, red chilli powder, salt to taste, kasoori methi leaves, coriander leaves. Mix well and saute for 2 minutes. Your stuffing is ready!
      Step 3 Prepare the dough for the Samosa
      Now, to prepare the dough, take a mixing bowl and combine all-purpose flour along with carom seeds and salt. Mix and then add ghee and start kneading by adding a little water at a time. Ensure that you add water gradually and make a firm dough. A soft dough will not make your samosas crispy. Cover the dough with a damp muslin cloth and keep aside for about half an hour.
      Step 4 Roll the dough in small puris and cut into half
      Once done, roll out few small-sized balls from the dough. Flatten them further with the help of your palms and then with a rolling pin. Give them a round shape and cut in half. Now dip your hands in water, fold the edges of the semi-circle in order to give it a cone shape.
      Step 5 Fill the semi-circle with potato filling and deep fry
      Take the filling with the help of a spoon and stuff it in the cone. Seal the ends properly by pressing the edges lightly with your fingers. Then, heat olive oil in a pan and deep fry the samosas on low heat until they turn golden brown and crispy. Serve with tomato ketchup and green chutney. Enjoy it as a tea-time snack!</p>

    <h2>Tandoori Fish Tikka</h2>
    <p>One of the most common dishes at seafood restaurants across Mumbai will always include Tandoori Pomfret. Pomfret was the preferred choice fish when I grew in the city. A flat fish, delicate and flaky which takes to the marinade and charred smokey tandoor flavours  really well.Buying pomfret was always a luxury (for us at least!) not just was it expensive but the prized centre piece at dinner parties when used in curries and pan fried with masala. And knowing my mother nothing was ever done by halves so a fish curry would have two full sized pomfrets cut into steaks with some pieces left for frying up to go with fish curry rice. I savoured it, every bite eaten of the curry rice with a portion of masala fried fish was what made that trip to the fish markets followed by cleaning and cooking the fish so worth it.
      Ingredients
      520gms monkfish fillets cut into 4cm chunks
      1 tsp lemon juice
      Pinch of salt
      4-5 wooden skewers
      Melted butter for basting (around 1-2tbsps)
      Lemon juice or chaat masala for garnish
      Mint chutney to serve
      For the marinade;
      3 garlic cloves roughly chopped
      ½" ginger roughly chopped
      1 heaped tbsp thick greek yoghurt
      ½ tsp mild chilli powder (mild paprika would be great or kashmiri chilli powder)
      1 tsp cumin powder
      ¼ tsp coarsely ground white pepper powder
      1 heaped tsp chick pea flour
      1 tbsp fresh coriander finely chopped
      1 tsp vegetable oil
      Salt to taste
      Tikka How to Make Tandoori Fish
      Add the monkfish to a mixing bowl along with the lemon juice and salt. Mix well and set aside.In a blender add the garlic and ginger along with a splash of water to make a thick smooth paste.2.
      Soak the wooden skewers in warm water until you make the marinade.
      In a separate bowl add the blended garlic and ginger paste along with the rest of the marinade ingredients. Mix well and add the monkfish cubes to the marinade. Leave to marinate for 15-20minutes.
      Preheat the grill  to a medium to high setting. Skewer the fish onto the wooden skewers. Pat the extra marinade over the pieces and place under the grill. Grill for 10-12 mins or until just done. Baste with butter half way through cooking.
      Serve the Tandoori fish tikka over roti with a sprinkle of lemon juice or chaat masala & serve with mint chutney.</p>

    <h2>Paneer Kofta</h2>
    <p>This is yet another classic Punjabi recipe of North Indian cuisine. This paneer recipe has two separate parts, first make kofta with paneer and then make tomato-based gravy. Whether you are looking for paneer kofta recipe to serve it as a snack or as a curry with gravy for sumptuous meal, this easy recipe will satisfy your needs and excite your palate.
      Ingredients
      Oil: Sautéing and frying are a breeze with this.
      Onions, Ginger, and Garlic: These give our sauce its flavorful base.
      Spices: Cumin powder, coriander and red chilli powder (or cayenne) add depth, making the dish distinctly earthy and warm.
      Tomato Puree: Lends a tangy, rich depth to the sauce.
      Almond Butter: This ingredient gives our sauce a nutty creaminess.
      Cream: Adds richness, making the dish totally luscious.
      Paneer and Potato: Grate paneer and combine with mashed potato to create the soft kofta balls.
      Raisins and Nuts: (Optional) Offer a hint of sweetness and a crunch. I leave them out sometimes to simplify for a weeknight.
      How to Make Malai Kofta
      Prepare Potatoes and Kofta Mixture:
      White potatoes are boiled and mashed together with paneer cheese, then studded with crunchy, sweet bits to make for a pillowy, delicious kofta.
      To begin, peel the potato and boil until tender. Once done, drain and let it cool.
      In a large bowl, grate or crumble the paneer. Incorporate the mashed potato, raisins, nuts, spices, and seasonings. Ensure everything is well-mixed and the spices are evenly distributed.
      How to Make Malai Kofta Gravy:
      Onion, ginger, garlic and fragrant Indian spices are sauteed then simmered in a rich sauce made from tomato puree, heavy cream and nut butter.
      In a pan, heat oil or ghee over medium-low heat. Add onions and a teaspoon of salt. Aim for a deep golden brown, taking about 25 minutes. This step is very important for the sauce’s slightly-sweet flavor.
      Next, add ginger and garlic to the onions, cooking until aromatic.
      Introduce the spices – cumin, coriander, cayenne, cinnamon, and cardamom pods. Cook a bit more.
      Pour in the tomato puree, almond butter, cream, sugar, remaining salt, and water. Let the mixture simmer until the oil surfaces with a shimmer.
      Shaping and Cooking the Koftas:
      The potato and cheese mixture is rolled into small dumplings to be fried. I used to deep fry them, which is the traditional way, but I find it more messy, more greasy, and more finicky. If the potatoes have too much moisture, they’ll often fall apart while deep frying. Pan-frying is simpler and much easier and more forgiving.</p>

    <h2>Eggplant Pakora</h2>
    <p>Eggplant/ baingan pakora is a classic fritter in which thin slices of eggplant are dunked in a spiced gram flour batter and fried till golden. Enjoy this vegan and gluten-free snack any time of the day!

      Ingredients
      ⦁	Eggplant: This is the main ingredient. Use a variety of eggplant that is firm and contains fewer seeds. Depending on the eggplant, you can either cut long or circular slices of approximately 1/2 cm thickness. Remember to clean and wash the eggplant and check for any worms when slicing.
      Gram Flour (Besan): Use fresh and good-quality gram flour. This is easily available at the Indian grocery store, or you can purchase it on Amazon.
      Spices: You need a few basic spices like – Kashmiri red chili powder, cumin (jeera) powder, turmeric (Haldi) powder, and coriander (dhaniya) powder and salt.
      ⦁	Chaat Masala: A dash of chaat masala on the eggplant pakoras as a garnish lends a unique tangy taste! You can buy it at the Indian store or on Amazon.
      ⦁	Oil: Use any vegetable oil with a high smoking point for deep frying the fritters.
      
      How To Make Eggplant Pakora
      Making these eggplant pakoras is easy, and the process is similar to other pakoras, where the battered eggplant is deep fried.
      Make the batter
      Add all the batter ingredients, including besan and spices to a bowl. Add little water as needed to make a thick flowing batter. Let it rest for 10-15 minutes.
      Pro-tip: In case you are in a hurry, and don’t have time to let the batter rest, add a pinch of baking soda to the batter. This will make the pakoras crunchy.
      
      Prep the Eggplant
      Wash and dry the eggplant. Cut the eggplant into thin slices. Sprinkle the spices – salt, Kashmiri red chili powder, chaat masala, and cumin powder. Mix well.
      Fry the pakoras
      Heat oil in a kadai or deep fryer on medium-high flame. You can use any neutral-tasting oil with a high smoking point. To coat each side, take each eggplant slice and dip it in the batter evenly. Add carefully in the medium hot oil.
      Fry till the eggplant fritters are golden and crisp on all sides. Use a slotted spoon to turn them a few times while they cook evenly. Using a slotted spoon, remove the baingan pakoras and transfer them to a plate lined with a paper towel to drain excess oil.
      Serve the eggplant pakora hot or warm with Indian green chutney or tomato ketchup. Sprinkle some chaat masala, and enjoy.</p>

Kaju is the Hindi word for cashews. This recipe of kaju masala has an overload of cashews as they are added twice during the cooking process. Serve with roti, naan, paratha or steamed rice for a sumptuous and filling lunch or dinner.
      Ingredients:
      1 cup Cashew Nuts (halved or broken or whole)
      1 large Onion, chopped (approx. 1/2 cup)
      2 large Tomato, chopped (approx. 3/4 cup)
      1-inch long piece of Cinnamon
      1-2 small cloves of Garlic, chopped
      1/2 inch piece of Ginger, chopped
      1 Green Chilli, chopped
      1 tablespoon grated Beetroot, optional (added to get dark red color)
      1/2 teaspoon Red Chilli Powder
      1 teaspoon Cumin-Coriander Powder, optional
      A pinch of Turmeric Powder, optional
      1/2 cup Milk (or water)
      1/2 cup Water
      1/2 teaspoon Kasuri Methi, (Dried Fenugreek Leaves), optional
      2 tablespoons finely chopped Coriander Leaves, for garnishing.
      How to make Kaju Curry
      Sauté Cashews (Kaju)
      1. First heat 1 tablespoon butter or oil in a pan or kadai. Make sure that the butter does not brown. So melt the butter on a low heat.
      2. Then add 1 cup Kaju or 120 grams whole cashews.
      3. Stir and saute the cashews till they become golden on low to medium-low heat.
      4. Remove them on a plate and keep them aside.
      5. In the same pan there will be some butter remaining. Add 1 tej patta (Indian bay leaf) and saute for a few seconds on low heat.
      6. Then add 1.5 cups roughly chopped tomatoes and ½ cup water. About 4 medium or 3 large sized tomatoes. Stir and mix well and simmer the mixture on a medium to high heat till the tomatoes soften. You can also cover the pan and cook the tomatoes.
      7. When the tomatoes are simmering, take 18 to 20 cashews in a grinder or blender.
      8. Powder them to a very fine texture. If fat is released while grinding or blending cashews, then it is alright. Scrape the sides and powder them finely.
      9. Remove and keep the ground cashews aside.
      10. Meanwhile, the tomatoes have softened. Switch off the heat and allow the tomatoes to become warm or cool down completely.
      11. Discard the tej patta and add the tomatoes to the same grinder or blender jar in which we had ground the cashews.
      12. Blend the tomatoes into a smooth puree. Keep aside.
      13. In the same pan in which we sauteed the cashews and cooked the tomatoes, heat 2 tablespoons of butter on low heat.
      14. Add 1 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste (1 inch ginger + 3 to 4 garlic crushed to paste in a mortar-pestle).
      Stir and saute for some seconds or till the raw aroma of ginger-garlic goes away.
      15. Then add the cashew powder.
      16. Stir and mix to combine.
      17. On a low heat, keep on stirring the cashew powder, so that it cooks uniformly. You have to stir continuously, otherwise the cashew powder sticks to the pan and can get burned or too browned.
      18. Stir till the color of the cashew powder changes to a pale light golden and you get a nice aroma. However don’t brown the cashew powder.
      19. Then add the prepared tomato puree.
      20. Stir and mix very well.
      21. Saute the tomato puree for about 4 minutes on a low to medium heat. Keep on stirring often.
      22. Then add ½ teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder or deghi mirch. Stir and mix very well.
      23. Now add ⅔ to ¾ cup water or as required. Stir and mix again.
      24. Add 1 to 2 slit green chilies.
      25. Simmer the gravy for 3 to 4 minutes on a low to medium heat.
      26. Garnish with coriander leaves. Serve kaju masala with tandoori roti, naan, phulka or paratha. You can also serve it with cumin rice or veg pulao or steamed basmati rice or saffron rice or ghee rice.
      The leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container and used within a day.

      After the chana has soaked, drain all the water, add 3/4 cup fresh water, and pressure cook the chana till it is soft. The chana must break when pressed between the forefinger and thumb.
      Tip: I made the tarri first and left it simmering on the stove as I made the Kanda Pohe. This is because the Pohe need to be warm and the Tarri needs hot when served.

    <h2>Spring Onion Curry</h2>
    <p>Spring onions are available only during a short season each year. Whenever I see them in the market, I grab one or two bunches and prepare various dishes to satisfy my taste buds.
      Spring onions are very nutritious. They are rich in soluble fiber, vitamins, folate, and minerals that are essential for our health.
      This particular curry is moderately spicy and flavorful. No grinding is required in this recipe, which makes it very simple, easy, and quick (I was able to make this dish in only 30 minutes). I served the curry with chapati, but you can pair it with any type of flatbread or with flavored rice.
      Now, let me share with you the detailed recipe.
      Ingredients
      
      ⦁	2 cups spring onion greens, washed and roughly chopped in half inch pieces.
      ⦁	spring onion whites, finely chopped
      ⦁	2 tablespoons onions, finely chopped
      ⦁	1 tablespoon ginger-green chili-garlic paste, crush 1 green chili, 3 garlic cloves and 1/2 inch ginger
      ⦁	2 tomatoes, finely chopped
      ⦁	1 tablespoon oil
      ⦁	1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder
      ⦁	1 teaspoon ⦁	coriander powder
      ⦁	1/2 teaspoon garam masala powder
      ⦁	salt to taste
      ⦁	1/4 teaspoon red chili powder
      Instructions:
      
      ⦁	Wash spring onions thoroughly. Separate the white and green portions. Chop them separately. Set aside.
      ⦁	In a blender, add green chili, ginger, and garlic cloves. Make a paste. Set aside.
      ⦁	Heat some oil in a deep bottomed pan. Throw in chopped onions and spring onion whites. Saute until the onions turn pinkish.
      ⦁	Add the ginger-green chili-garlic paste. Continue sauteing the mixture for a few seconds or until you smell the nice aroma from the roasted herbs.
      ⦁	Throw in the chopped tomatoes. Add some salt. Keep the heat medium-high. Cook until the tomatoes turn mushy.
      ⦁	Add the dry spices: turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, and garam masala powder. While reducing heat, saute the mixture for 30 seconds.
      ⦁	Add chopped spring onion greens. Increase the heat to medium-high, and saute until the spring onion greens wilt. Add 2 cups of water. Reduce the flame.
      ⦁	Cover the pan. Add remaining salt. Let the mixture come to a gentle boil. Simmer it until the spring onion greens become soft yet crunchy. At this point, the curry reaches a semi-solid consistency.
      ⦁	Turn off heat. Your favorite spring onion curry is ready! Transfer it to a serving pot.
      ⦁	Serve it with flatbread or fragrant rice. Enjoy the combo!

    <h2>Amtekai Gojju</h2>
    <p>The Indian hog plum is also known as Amtekai or Ambade and if you haven't, you are really missing something. It's tangy and looks little similar to tiny raw mango . That's why may be it's called wild mangoes too. Amtekai is a very popular fruit in Coastal Karnataka and is used as a souring agent to make pickles, curries , chutneys, raita and much more.
      The Amtekai Gojju Recipe is a classic dish made from this fruit which is flavored with traditional south indian spices in a coconut curry base. Serve the Amtekai Gojju along with steamed rice topped with ghee for a delicious lunch or a weeknight dinner.
      Ingredients
      ⦁	4 to 5 Hog Plum (Amtekai)
      ⦁	1/4 cup Jaggery
      ⦁	1/2 teaspoon Turmeric powder (Haldi)
      ⦁	Salt , to taste
      For Gojju Masala
      ⦁	1 cup Fresh coconut , grated
      ⦁	2 teaspoons White Urad Dal (Split)

      ⦁	1 sprig Curry leaves
      How to make Amtekai Gojju Recipe - Indian Hog Plum Curry
      ⦁	To begin making the Amtekai Gojju Recipe (Indian Hog Plum Curry), first get all the ingredients prepped and ready.
      ⦁	Wash and lightly scrape the skin of the amtekai. Cut amtekai to pieces and don't discard the seed.
      ⦁	Place amtekai (hog plum) along with seed in a saucepan with a cup of water and jaggery and bring it to a brisk boil. Once it comes to a boil, turn the heat to low and simmer until the amtekai (hog plum) is soft. The pit (Seed) will be hard & is not edible but after cooking, it absorbs in all the flavors and spices. It 's a wonderful treat to suck its juice. 
      ⦁	Meanwhile in a small pan add few drops of oil. Add all the ingredients mentioned under masala except coconut and sesame. Roast them in medium low flame till red chillies becomes crisp and dal turns golden color. Add coconut to that and just saute for about minute. Once done, transfer all the ingredients to a mixer jar.
      ⦁	Next,dry roast sesame seeds in the same pan till it turns golden. Add the sesame seeds to the mixer jar containing other roasted masala ingredients. Once it's little cooled, add little water and make a very smooth paste.
      ⦁	Add gojju masala ground paste & salt to cooked amtekai (hog plum) and mix well. Cook this in a medium flame till the amtekai gojju starts boiling.
      ⦁	Turn the heat to low and add a tablespoon of raw coconut oil and allow it to boil for another 8-10 mins. Stir in between and allow the amtekai gojju to thicken. Check the salt and spices and adjust to suit your taste and turn off the heat.
      ⦁	Transfer the gojju to a serving bowl.
      ⦁	The final step is to make the seasoning. Heat oil in a small pan over medium heat; add the mustard and allow it to crackle. Add the curry leaves and asafoetida and stir for a few seconds and add this seasoning to the Amtekai Gojju.
      ⦁	Serve the Amtekai Gojju along with steamed rice topped with ghee for a delicious lunch or a weeknight dinner or even for breakfast along with idlis or dosas</p>

    <h2>Rasmalai</h2>
    <p>Rasmalai is yet another one of my favorite sweets. This Bengali specialty is made with rasgulla (sweetened balls of paneer) soaked in sweetened, thickened milk that has been scented with cardamom and saffron. The result is a creamy, dreamy dessert that absolutely melts in your mouth. Make this soft and tasty Rasmalai recipe with my easy step-by-step photos.
      Ingredients 
      1X2X3X
      For the rasmalai balls
      ⦁	▢1 liter whole milk
      ⦁	▢4 tablespoons lemon juice
      ⦁	▢1 teaspoon cornflour
      ⦁	▢4 cups water
      ⦁	▢1 cup sugar
      For the ras [syrup]
      ⦁	▢500 ml whole milk
      ⦁	▢5-6 green cardamom pods peeled and crushed to get the powder
      ⦁	▢saffron a pinch
      ⦁	▢3-4 tablespoons sugar
      ⦁	▢finely chopped pistachios
      Save t
      
      How to make Rasmalai
      Preparation
      1. To make Rasmalai, you will need 12 to 15 rasgulla. You can either make them at home or you can use store bought ones.
      My detailed step-by-step post on How to make Rasgulla, is an excellent primer for those of you who wish to cook entirely from scratch.
      2. Boil ½ cup water, then add 10 to 12 almonds. Cover and keep aside for 30 to 40 minutes.
      Note: Usually both almonds and pistachios are added, but I had run out of pistachios, so I just used almonds. You can add about 10 to 12 each of the almonds and pistachios.
      ⦁	After 30 minutes, peel the almonds and slice them thinly. Set aside.
      Make Rabri
      4. While the almonds are blanching, take 1 liter of full fat whole milk in a thick bottomed pan or kadai.
      5. Bring the milk to a boil on medium heat
      6. While the milk is coming to a boil, take 2 tablespoons of warm milk from the pan and add it to a small bowl. Add 8 to 10 saffron strands. Stir and keep aside.
      7. Once the milk has come to a boil, lower the heat and simmer the milk. Collect the floating cream and push it to the sides of the pan using a spoon or spatula.
      Continue to cook this way until the milk is reduced to half.
      8. Keep on collecting the cream which floats on the top and move it to the sides. Also keep stirring the milk at intervals so that the milk does not scorch. 
      This process of reducing the milk will take about 20 to 25 minutes after the first boil on a low to medium heat.
      9. Once the milk has reduced to half of its original volume, add 4 to 5 tablespoons of sugar, or according to your taste.
      10. Mix well so that the sugar dissolves. Scrape the milk solids from the sides and reincorporate them into the simmering milk.
      11. Add ½ teaspoon green cardamom powder.
      12. Add most of the sliced almonds (and pistachios if you have used them), reserving a few for garnish.
      13. Also add the saffron dissolved milk.
      14. Stir to incorporate. Keep simmering the reduced milk at a low heat and stir occasionally. Check the taste and add more sugar if required.
      I usually do not thicken the milk quite to Rabri consistency, as the rasgullas need to soak some of the sweetened milk. Just reduce the milk till it’s roughly half of its original quantity.
      Make Rasmalai
      15. Take each rasgulla and gently apply pressure with a spatula so the sugar syrup is removed from it. You can also press and squeeze the rasgulla in your palms.
      Be gentle and don’t apply too much pressure, as the rasgulla will break. There should be no sugar syrup in the rasgulla.
      16. Press all the rasgulla balls this way.
      17. Now place the squeezed rasgullas in the simmering milk.
      18. Simmer for 2 to 3 minutes on low heat. You can omit this step and simply place the rasgulla in the prepared rabdi.
      But they will be more juicy and flavorful if you let them simmer for a couple of minutes.
      19. Turn off the heat and add 1 to 2 teaspoons of either rose water or kewra water (pandanus water).
      20. Stir gently. Cover and let the rasmalai come to room temperature, then chill thoroughly in the fridge in a covered bowl or container.
      Serve rasmalai garnished with some sliced almonds or pistachios and saffron strands. You can also serve rasmalai warm or at room temperature if you prefer. Enjoy!</p>

    <h2>Rice Kheer</h2>
    <p>The Indian version of a sweet pudding is what we refer to as Kheer. It is basically a milk-based dessert, which has other ingredients, sweetener and flavorings added to it. The most classic version of this dessert is the rich Rice Kheer, where you slow-cook rice grains, whole milk and sugar to perfection. Addition of saffron, nuts, cardamom, etc. is quite subjective when it comes to this typical Kheer Recipe. This particular creamy version is my family’s heirloom recipe which you will love for its deliciousness.  
      RICE KHEER INGREDIENTS
      ⦁	Rice – I used raw rice but alternatively you can use basmati rice too.
      ⦁	Milk – Use full fat milk, I used cows milk which needs a bit more boiling time.
      ⦁	Sugar – I used regular white sugar. You can use brown sugar or cane sugar too.
      ⦁	Nuts – I have used almonds and pistachios. You can use cashews, raisins and other favourite nuts too. You can even ghee roast the nuts and add it for extra crunch.
      ⦁	Flavouring – I have used cardamom powder, saffron and rose water which suits best for Rice Kheer.
      Instructions
      0.	First soak 1/4 cup raw rice in water till immersing level. You can use basmati rice instead of raw rice. Soak in water for 30 mins.
      1.	Rinse rice 2-3 times, strain and set aside.
      2.	In a large pot – add 4 cups milk ie 1 litre milk.
      3.	Let it come to a rolling boil.
      4.	Simmer for 5 mins, meanwhile keep stirring and scarping the sides to collect the malai and add it to the boiling milk itself.
      5.	Now add soaked, drained rice to the milk. Give a quick mix.
      Pressure Cooker Method :Incase you want to pressure cook rice then pressure cook for 2-3 whistles in medium flame and switch off. Use a tall cooker so that milk does not overflow also drop a small spoon / plate inside to avoid overflowing.
      Instant Pot Method :Set mode to pressure cook high for 10 mins. Let pressure release by itself then proceed with the next steps.
      0.	Cook until rice turns soft, try to press the rice with a spoon if its mashable then rice is cooked perfectly.
      1.	Now add 1/4 cup sugar.
      2.	Add 1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder and few strands of saffron.
      3.	Simmer until kheer becomes slightly thick. Meanwhile keep stirring in between scrap the sides and add the malai to the kheer.
      4.	Mash the rice slightly.
      5.	Add 1 tablespoon chopped mixed nuts. You can add more also if you like, we love to sprinkle the nuts while serving so I add very little. If you prefer you can even roast the nuts in ghee and add.
      6.	Now add 1 teaspoon rose water(optional) and switch off.
      7.	Switch off when it is still slightly runny as it thickens with time. Rice Kheer is ready to serve.
      8.	Serve Rice Kheer hot or cold as per your preference.</p>

    <h2>Malpua</h2>
    <p>Malpua is a traditional North Indian sweet of sugar syrup coated pancakes made with all-purpose flour, curd (yogurt), spices, khoya (dried milk solids) and topped with nuts. Malpua recipe is often made during festivals, special occasions and are a street food as well. Soft and fluffy on the inside, yet crisp and lacy on the outside, these syrup dipped pancakes are a real treat – especially when you serve them with Rabri!
      How to Make Malpua Recipe
      Make Batter
      1. In a mixing bowl, add 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon fennel seeds (saunf), and 3 to 4 crushed green cardamom pods (discard the peels) or ⅓ teaspoon cardamom powder. Mix the dry ingredients well.
      
      dry ingredients for malpua batter in a bowl
      
      2. Add 3 tablespoons grated khoya (mawa or dried milk solids) and 3 tablespoons curd/yogurt. Please use fresh yogurt.
      
      You can use whole milk powder or dairy whitener instead of khoya.
      
      khoya and yogurt added to dry ingredients
      
      3. Add ½ cup water.
      
      add water for malpua recipe
      
      4. Begin to stir with a wired whisk.
      
      whisking batter - it is initially clumpy
      
      5. Stir to a thick to medium-thick, flowing batter without any lumps. Cover and allow the batter to rest for 30 to 40 minutes or up to about 2 hours at room temperature.

      Prepare Nuts
      7. While the batter is resting, blanch the almonds and pistachios in hot water. Keep them soaked in hot water for 20 to 30 minutes, then peel them.

      8. Slice them and keep them aside.

      Prepare Sugar Syrup
      9. Just before you begin to fry the malpua, prepare the sugar syrup. Heat ½ cup sugar and ¼ cup water. Here I have used raw sugar, hence this golden color.
      
      sugar mixture for malpua recipe
      10. Simmer this mixture on low heat, stirring well so the sugar melts.
      
      simmering sugar mixture
      11. You need to have a ½ string or 1 string consistency in the sugar syrup. If you cannot achieve these string consistencies then just make a sticky syrup.
      
      The sugar syrup must be kept warm. Keep the sugar syrup pan on top of a bowl or another pan filled with hot water to prevent the sugar from crystalizing. The hot water should touch the base of the pan containing the sugar syrup.

      Fry Malpua
      12. Heat 4 tablespoons ghee in a pan or griddle. Here I am shallow frying the malpua instead of deep-frying them.
      
      You can deep fry them if you prefer, though you’ll need much more ghee.
      
      For a lighter version, you can use any neutral flavored oil for frying. You can also use less oil and cook them like pancakes.
      
      ghee on a shallow griddle pan
      13. Add 3 pinches (⅛ teaspoon) baking soda to the malpua batter before frying. Instead of baking soda, you can add ½ teaspoon of baking powder.
      
      baking soda being added to malpua batter
      14. Mix very well. This is important as you want the baking soda to be mixed evenly.

      15. Lower the heat. Either take 2 to 3 tablespoons or a ladle of the batter and gently pour it on the hot ghee.
      
      Spread the batter lightly with the back of the spoon. Make 2 to 4 malpua at a time, depending on the size of the pan. Fry on low to medium heat.

      17. Flip once more and fry the other side.

      18. Flip again and fry till they have a crisp edge and are golden. Working in batches, continue to fry malpua this way, adding more ghee if required.

      20. After a quick drain on paper towels, immediately place the fried malpua in the warm sugar syrup.
      
      Just a reminder the sugar syrup should be hot or warm as mentioned above.

      How to Serve Malpua
      In my opinion, malpua should be served hot or warm. If you serve them at room temperature or chill them, then they become chewy. But if you like chewy texture, you can serve them chilled.

    <h2>Chicken Soup</h2>
    <p>Chicken soup is to make when you’re craving simple comfort food or feeling under the weather. Made with bone-in chicken thighs simmered into a flavourful broth and filled with tender onions, carrots, celery, and juicy shredded chicken.
      Ingredients Required-
      1.Chicken
      2.Broth
      3.Vegetables
      4.Herbs
      Preparation-
       1. Make your broth: Since we’re not making chicken stock, this should only take about 30-45 minutes at the most. Simply add the raw chicken thighs to a large stockpot, cover with cold water, and bring to a boil. Reduce to medium-low heat and simmer until the chicken is fully cooked. If you’re short on time, skip this step and use your favorite store-bought chicken stock and add shredded rotisserie chicken.
      2. Cook the vegetables: While you wait for your chicken to finish cooking, cook the vegetables in a separate pot or Dutch oven set over medium heat. Cook the vegetables for 10-15 minutes or until they start to soften. Toward the end, add the salt, black pepper, bay leaves, and garlic (if using).
      3. Strain the broth: Once the chicken is fully cooked, carefully remove the chicken from the pot and strain the broth through a fine mesh strainer into the same pot containing the vegetables.
      4. Shred the chicken once it is cool enough to handle. Do not return the chicken to the pot.
      5. Simmer & serve: Simmer for 30 minutes, or until the vegetables are fully cooked and tender. In the last 10 minutes, add the shredded chicken and lemon juice and season to taste.

    <h2>Sushi</h2>
    <p>Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish that typically consists of vinegared rice, various seafood, and 
      vegetables, often wrapped in seaweed (nori). There are many different types of sushi, but some 
      popular ingredients include raw fish (such as tuna, salmon, or yellowtail), cooked seafood (like 
      shrimp or crab), vegetables (such as cucumber, avocado, or pickled radish), and sometimes egg or 
      tofu.
      Here's a simple recipe for making sushi at home:
      IngredIents:
      Sushi rice (short-grain rice)
      Nori sheets (seaweed)
      Fresh fish or cooked seafood of your choice
      Vegetables (cucumber, avocado, carrots, etc.)
      Rice vinegar
      Sugar
      Salt
      Soy sauce
      Wasabi (optional)
      Pickled ginger (optional)
      InstructIons:

      evenly over the nori, leaving about half an inch of space at the top.
      Arrange your desired fillings along the bottom edge of the rice.
      Using the sushi mat, roll the nori and rice over the fillings tightly, applying gentle pressure as you roll.
      Moisten the top edge of the nori with a bit of water to seal the roll.
      Use a sharp knife to slice the sushi roll into bite-sized pieces.

      paste evenly into the vegetables, ensuring they are well coated. Pack the kimchi into clean, airtight 
      containers, pressing down firmly to remove air bubbles.
      Fermentation: Leave the containers of kimchi at room temperature for 1-2 days to initiate 
      fermentation. After this initial fermentation period, transfer the kimchi to the refrigerator to continue 
      fermenting for another few days to develop its flavors. The longer you ferment it, the more tangy and 
      flavorful it will become.
      Enjoy: Once fermented to your liking, kimchi can be enjoyed as a side dish, added to soups, stews, 
      rice dishes, or used in various recipes for added flavor and complexity.
      Remember, kimchi is a versatile dish, and you can adjust the ingredients and seasonings to suit your 
      taste preferences. Feel free to experiment with different vegetables and spice levels to create your 
      own unique variation of this beloved Korean classic.</p>

    <h2>Menudo</h2>
    <p>Menudo is a traditional Mexican soup made with beef tripe (the stomach lining of a cow), typically in 
      a spicy broth. It is often served as a hearty breakfast or brunch dish, especially on weekends or 
      during special occasions. Menudo is known for its rich flavor and tender texture, and it's a beloved 
      comfort food in many regions of Mexico.
      IngredIents:
      2 pounds of beef tripe, cleaned and cut into small pieces
      1 onion, finely chopped
      4 cloves of garlic, minced
      1 can (28 ounces) of hominy, drained and rinsed
      2-3 dried guajillo chilies, stems and seeds removed
      2-3 dried arbol chilies, stems removed
      1 tablespoon of dried oregano
      1 teaspoon of ground cumin
      Salt and pepper to taste
      Water
      Optional toppings: chopped cilantro, diced onions, lime wedges, crushed red pepper flakes
      How to Make Menudo:
      Begin by thoroughly cleaning the beef tripe under cold running water. Remove any excess fat or 
      debris. Cut the tripe into small, bite-sized pieces.
      In a large pot, combine the beef tripe, chopped onion, minced garlic, and enough water to cover the 
      ingredients. Bring the pot to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer 
      for about 2-3 hours, or until the tripe is tender.
      While the tripe is simmering, prepare the dried chilies. Place them in a bowl and cover them with hot 
      water. Let them soak for about 20-30 minutes, until softened.
      Once the chilies are softened, drain them and transfer them to a blender. Add a cup of the cooking 
      liquid from the pot, along with the dried oregano, ground cumin, salt, and pepper. Blend until 
      smooth to make the chili paste.
      Once the tripe is tender, add the chili paste and drained hominy to the pot. Stir to combine, and 
      simmer for an additional 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
      Taste and adjust seasoning as needed. If the soup is too thick, you can add more water to reach your 
      desired consistency.
      Serve the menudo hot, garnished with chopped cilantro, diced onions, lime wedges, and crushed red 
      pepper flakes, if desired. Enjoy with warm tortillas or crusty bread.</p>
